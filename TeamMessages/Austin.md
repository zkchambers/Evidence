![Message2](TeamMessages/Austin.png)

I sent messages to Austin and communicated with him what progress I made and if he liked what I had created. I also asked many questions about things that I wasn't sure about and how the upskilling dashboard worked.

I sent other messages to Austin more work that I made and an idea of making the upskilling dashboard and skills page to be added on the navigation with a drop box.

# Teams message with App Attack Lead and Company Lead

![Message1](TeamMessages/AppAttack.png)

I was apart of a meeting with Charanpreet the App Attack Lead who wanted us to host their documentation website and maintain it by adding more documentation and resources when neccessary. I asked questions about what would be the best website to host the website which I decided to host the website myself with netlify.

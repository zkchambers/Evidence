# Having Navigation displayed on all pages

![Navigation](images/Navigation.PNG)

I used code:

 {% include 'includes/navigation.html'%}

I added the pre-existing naviagtion template using the code above to add the navigation to the sign up, sign in and reset password pages which didn't have the navigation displayig on these pages.

I shared code with Nick so that he had the search bar on his local side which he was able to start developing on the back end side.

Nick also shared the backend code so I was able to test on my side to see how the search results worked and see if I needed to change the search results page.

I was able to change the search results page to make it look nicer and communicated the code to Nick so that he could test it on his side as well.

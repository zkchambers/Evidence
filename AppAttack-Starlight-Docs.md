# AppAttack Docs using Astro and Starlight

![Logo](images/AppAttack-Logo.png)

```
logo: {
				src: './src/assets/app-attack-logo.png',
```
Added the logo to the search bar to have the logo every page you navigate to.


![Cards](images/Cards.png)

```
<CardGrid >
	<Card title="Penetration Testing" icon="seti:stylelint">
	</Card>
	<Card title="Secure Code Review" icon="add-document">
	</Card>
</CardGrid>
```
Changed the cards to not be staggered so that it looks better with each of them being inline with each other.

I also started hosting AppAttack-Docs through Netlify, which makes it accessible to anyone on the internet. Link: [AppAttack-Docs](https://app-attack-docs.netlify.app/).

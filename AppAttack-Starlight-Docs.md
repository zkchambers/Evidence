# AppAttack Docs using Astro and Starlight

<!-- Imaghe -->

```
logo: {
				src: './src/assets/app-attack-logo.png',
```
Added the logo to the search bar to have the logo every page you navigate to.

```
<CardGrid >
	<Card title="Penetration Testing" icon="seti:stylelint">
	</Card>
	<Card title="Secure Code Review" icon="add-document">
	</Card>
</CardGrid>
```
Changed the cards to not be staggered so that it looks better with each of them being inline with each other.
